        <p>Hello 👋🏻</p>
        <p>
          My name is Maciej Ziemichód. I'm a web developer, music addict and
          fitness freak.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my personal digital garden website where I drop thoughts and
          notes about things that I'm currently doing or interested in. It's a
          kind of journal, but without any specific order in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entries here aren't and probably won't be ever completed. They will
          grow as I come back to them to add more content. That's why it's
          called digital garden, my thoughts are growing plants.
        </p>

          You can contact me by email or twitter, I also have portfolio page.
          Links are in the footer.
        </p>

          If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and
          let me know. It's always nice to get feedback.
