                <p>Hello üëãüèª</p>
                <p>
                    My name is Maciej Ziemich√≥d. I'm a web developer, music
                    addict and physical activity enthusiast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is my personal digital garden website where I drop
                    thoughts and notes about things that I'm currently doing or
                    interested in. It's a kind of journal, but without any
                    specific order in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entries here aren't and probably won't be ever completed.
                    They will grow as I come back to them to add more content.
                    That's why it's called digital garden, my thoughts are
                    growing plants.
