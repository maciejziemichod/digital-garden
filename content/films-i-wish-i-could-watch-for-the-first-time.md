## Suspiria

I feel that if this film didn't have any dialogs it would be still one of the best I've watched. Motion is the main medium here, it expresses emotions, thoughts and actions. And I just love the idea of modern witches using dance as their magic transmitter.

## Arrival

Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis + aliens + nonlinear time + mysterious mood. This film is at the same time really simple and really complex. Not to mention visuals, scenes are just beautiful. I can't get it out of my head sometimes, it gives me some thoughts about human possibilities and our future.

## Interstellar

I guess I really like science fiction. That's another film that gives me some strangely positive vibes about future of humanity. I know that there are many interpretations of the movie, but I prefer the good ones, there are enough sad things happening either way.

## Annihilation

It's beautiful and disgusting at the same time. It's all about change, how can it affect surroundings and ourselves. I don't know, visual aspects of this film combined with philosophical contemplation speak to me.

## Elite

Well it's series, not a film but I had to mention it here because it's so addicting. The plot as well as characters - everything matches so perfectly that you feel the need to continue watching.

## Donnie Darko

I'm weird and so is Donnie Darko. It's a dark, twisted version of Alice in Wonderland. And the more times you watch it, the more you can understand because it's really thought provoking and doesn't get boring.

## The Dark Knight

Heath Ledger.

## House

For me Dr House is just iconic. I don't know how many times I've watched every season, probably like 3. Interesting medical cases combined with complex characters is the thing that makes me come back to this series.
