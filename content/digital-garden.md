This site is digital garden. It's a blog, but not really. First I've heard about its concept in Maggie Appleton's [article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Digital gardens are

> (...) collections of evolving ideas that aren't organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.

I like doing notes, so making one myself became a goal. And now you are reading a post, I'm so happy that I did it. This feels really relieving to put my thoughts on digital paper and to not have them running through my head. At the same time I value not caring too much about polishing what I write, still keeping this thing informative and useful in the future.

Long live digital gardens!
